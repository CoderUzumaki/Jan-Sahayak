## Introduction

In India, central and state governments launch hundreds of welfare schemes each year. However, many eligible citizens remain unaware of the benefits available to them due to several key challenges:

- Scattered information across multiple portals  
- Complex, jargon-filled language in official documents  
- Lack of personalized scheme discovery  
- Limited digital literacy, especially in rural areas  

As a result, millions of rupees in welfare funds go underutilized, and citizens miss out on critical support like health insurance, educational scholarships, and financial aid.

**Jan Sahayak** aims to bridge this gap through a centralized, user-centric platform. By simplifying access to relevant schemes, it empowers individuals and families to claim their rightful benefits, leading to greater financial security, improved healthcare access, and enhanced educational opportunities.
